# Customer Service Ticket Counter

A counter built using Django, Bootstrap and Plotly that allows customer service agents to keep track of their tickets.
- The front page displays three counters and starts each new day off at zero.
- You can add and subtract tickets by clicking ðŸ”¼ or ðŸ”½
- The tally of each tickets' value for the day is summed in the brackets at the bottom of the table.
- The total sum of all tallies for the day is in the top right corner

- The total number of tickets is stored in a database and rendered as a graph to the dashboard tab.
It will update as you click the ðŸ”¼ or ðŸ”½ buttons on the home page.
